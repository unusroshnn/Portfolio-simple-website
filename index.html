        <p class="section-two__disc">I am Unus, currently pursuing my final year of B.Tech in Information Technology at
            SREC College. I have a strong
            passion for learning new concepts in the IT field, with a particular interest in frontend technologies, web
            development, and software development.
            So far, I have built three academic projects, each designed to provide practical solutions and add value to
            users. Through these projects,I have gained experience in coding, problem-solving, and implementing ideas
            into
            working applications.I am always eager to explore new tools, frameworks, and technologies that enhance the
            development process. Along
            with technical learning, I also focus on improving my teamwork, communication, and analytical skills to grow
            as
            a well-rounded IT professional.My long-term goal is to contribute to projects that solve real-world problems
            and create a meaningful impact
            through technology. I strongly believe in continuous learning and innovation, which keeps me motivated to
            grow
            and adapt in this fast-evolving industry.
